----
recognize a page of a book
identify the landmarks on the page
search the db for the current book
if not in db, add the book to db

identify landmarks
----
ignore landmarks which are very small
store number of landmarks
find boundary points of each landmark
for entry in database:
    if entry[no_of_landmarks] >= current_no_of_landmarks:
        compare points with that in database
    else
        continue

continuosly learning Neural Net
----
Train neural network to find page edges
Run the neural network on the phone app
Neural network finds the page edges
If not accurate, the user can correct the edges
Correction is used for more training
H5Py to the rescue :D
Eventually, we get very accurate neural network
